Movies Application is a cross-platform mobile application designed for movie enthusiasts. It offers an interactive way to explore a vast collection of movies, posters, and trailers.

The application is developed using Flutter, making it compatible with both iOS and Android devices. The backend services are efficiently handled by Spring Boot and the data is stored in MongoDB.
